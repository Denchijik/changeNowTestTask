This is a test project for ChangeNow.
The idea is to get the current ETH/BTC rate and update every 0.1/1/10 second (can be changed in variable UPDATE_INTERVAL).
Because the intervals were small - the difference is shown with up to 6 digits (0.000001%).

P.S. The useRecursiveTimeout hook was taken from here: https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2019-09-23-recursive-settimeout-with-react-hooks/
